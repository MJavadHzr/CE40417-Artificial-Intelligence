And Output of this function is a **goal state of search** (if a goal is found), else **FALSE**. <br/>\n",

So while there is time, we call the search method of the search engine (**se**) and we look for a path with minimum cost and to save time, We use cost-bounder to prune states which have bigger f_value than the best path cost we found so far. Costbounder is a three tuple that is like (g_val, h_val, g_val + h_val) which each of these 3 are like limit for pruning successor state. Please pay attention that in this version, we prune only when the current final f is larger than best_path_cost<br/>\n",
